# Latent fingerprint reconstruction using Generative Convolutional Networks

This repository contains code for the paper [Generative Convolutional Networks for Latent Fingerprint Reconstruction
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01707) by Jan Svoboda, Federico Monti and Michael M. Bronstein.

Current implementation reuses parts of the following [DCGAN implementation](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code).

It is based on older Theano 0.9 and CUDNN backend.

## Data generation ##
### Anguli ###
Synthetic data can be generated by means of [Anguli](http://dsl.cds.iisc.ac.in/projects/Anguli/).

Anguli reimplements the main algorithms from commercial SFinGe synthetic fingerprint generator. Generation of
some simple transformations/distortions and noise can be selected.

It always generates the original fingerprint as well so we implicitly have the reference sample we would like to
obtain from the damaged one.

### Synthetic latent fingerprints ###
In order to generate more "latent-like" synthetic samples, we use the Matlab script generate_fingerprints.m from the "data_generation" folder, which can further 
adds some blur and blends the fingerprint on different backgrounds.

### Data samples ###
A subset of one of the synthetic datasets is provided [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbviqxosd7vwijs/data_samples.zip?dl=0). 
It can be used to test the code running training and testing on it.

### Sample trained model ###
One model trained on our synthetic data for testing purposes is provided [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xg2gkjcmng0p4z4/model_params_350.pkl?dl=0).

### Using the code ###
The whole codebase, including dataset loading, model definition, training and testing is now provided in form of an ipython notebook in the "gae" folder.

Make sure that "cwd_path" and "data_path" in the notebook are set correctly. Also, make sure that "Data stuff" part of the notebook can find the folders the data are
to be loaded from.

The whole notebook should be able to run in a cell-by-cell manner.

Comments are added inside of the notebook where needed.
