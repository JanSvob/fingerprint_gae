# Latent fingerprint reconstruction using Generative Convolutional Networks

This repository contains code for the paper [Generative Convolutional Networks for Latent Fingerprint Reconstruction
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01707) by Jan Svoboda, Federico Monti and Michael M. Bronstein.

Current implementation reuses parts of the following [https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code](DCGAN implementation).

It is based on older Theano 0.9 and CUDNN backend.

## Data generation ##
### Anguli ###
Synthetic data can be generated by means of [Anguli](http://dsl.cds.iisc.ac.in/projects/Anguli/).

Anguli reimplements the main algorithms from commercial SFinGe synthetic fingerprint generator. Generation of
some simple transformations/distortions and noise can be selected.

Anguli always generates the original fingerprint as well so we implicitly have the reference sample we would like to
obtain from the damaged one.

### Synthetic latent fingerprints ###
In order to generate more "latent-like" synthetic samples, we use the Matlab script generate_fingerprints.m, which can further 
adds some blur and blends the fingerprint on different backgrounds.
